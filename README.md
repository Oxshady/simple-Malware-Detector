# Malware Detection Project

This project is designed to detect malicious files within a specified directory by calculating their hash values and comparing them against a database of known malicious hashes. Additionally, the project integrates with the VirusTotal API to scan files for malware.

## Features

1. **Hash Calculation**:
   - Calculates multiple types of hashes for files, including MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, and CRC32.
   - Stores detailed information about each file, including its name, location, parent directory, hash algorithm used, and the resulting hash value.

2. **Archive Extraction**:
   - Extracts various types of compressed files, such as `.zip`, `.gz`, `.tar`, `.bz2`, `.xz`, and `.rar`.
   - Automatically deletes the original archive files after extraction.

3. **Malicious Hash Database**:
   - Compares calculated file hashes with a database of known malicious hashes.
   - Reads and stores malicious hashes from a provided text file.

4. **VirusTotal Integration**:
   - Uses the VirusTotal API to scan files based on their hash values.
   - Checks the number of scanners flagging a file as malicious and reports the findings.

5. **File Information Display**:
   - Prints detailed information about each file, including its hash values and scan results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pathlib`
  - `shutil`
  - `rarfile`
  - `hashlib`
  - `requests`
